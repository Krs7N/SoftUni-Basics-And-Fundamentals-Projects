Here I will be posting my SoftUni course works
------------------------------------------------------
My first folders are revision from my basics course in SoftUni:<br/>
 - Last exercise from the initial revision was with the help of the debugger and the troubleshooting integrated in Microsoft Visual Studio 2019. My task was to use the debugger and find the bugs that are causing the program to not functioning properly
 - I found the bugs and this is the fixed code:

 - What this piece of code does is - user enters 2 dates (1 as starting date, 1 as end date) and the program generates the holidays (saturdays and sundays) that are in this period of time.![consoleResult](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102831846/169688269-39daeb45-73bd-4eac-871f-3642b4863475.png)
